Here’s a beginner-friendly “cheat-sheet” for all the SMPP PDUs you listed. I’ve grouped them by function and for each PDU given:

• Direction (who sends to whom)    
• Purpose in one line    
• Key fields you’ll commonly see

— — — — — — — — — —
1. Session Establishment & Teardown    
   — — — — — — — — — —

• bind_transmitter    
– ESME → SMSC    
– “Please let me in as a transmitter (I only want to send SMS).”    
– system_id, password, system_type, interface_version, addr_ton/npi, address_range

• bind_transmitter_resp    
– SMSC → ESME    
– “OK (or not) — here’s your bind status and my system_id.”    
– command_status (0 = OK), system_id, optional TLVs

• bind_receiver    
– ESME → SMSC    
– “Please let me in as a receiver (I only want to get SMS).”    
– same credential fields as bind_transmitter

• bind_receiver_resp    
– SMSC → ESME    
– “Here’s the result of your receiver bind.”    
– command_status, system_id, optional TLVs

• bind_transceiver    
– ESME → SMSC    
– “Let me in as both transmitter & receiver on one session.”    
– same credential fields

• bind_transceiver_resp    
– SMSC → ESME    
– “Transceiver bind result (OK or error).”    
– command_status, system_id, optional TLVs

• outbind    
– SMSC → ESME (unsolicited)    
– “Hey, please bind to me now (I have MO messages waiting).”    
– system_id, password, optional addressing parameters

• unbind    
– Either side → the other    
– “I’m closing this SMPP session—goodbye.”    
– no body fields

• unbind_resp    
– Receiver of unbind → originator    
– “Goodbye acknowledged—closing now.”    
– no body fields

2. SMS Submission & Delivery    
   — — — — — — — — — —

• submit_sm    
– ESME → SMSC    
– “Here’s an SMS to send.”    
– service_type, source_addr, dest_addr, esm_class, protocol_id, data_coding, short_message or message_payload, validity_period, registered_delivery

• submit_sm_resp    
– SMSC → ESME    
– “Got it (or failed). Your message_id = …”    
– command_status, message_id

• submit_sm_multi    
– ESME → SMSC    
– “Here’s one SMS for multiple destinations.”    
– same as submit_sm + a repeating destination_list (TON/NPI + address)

• submit_sm_multi_resp    
– SMSC → ESME    
– “Result for your multi-submit: message_id = … and list of any failed destinations.”    
– message_id, optional unsuccessful_delivery_TLVs

• data_sm    
– Bidirectional (ESME ↔ SMSC)    
– “A lightweight ‘generic’ SMS exchange—can send or receive a message.”    
– service_type, source_addr, dest_addr, esm_class, data_coding, optional payload

• data_sm_resp    
– Receiver of data_sm → sender    
– “Ack or Nack of that data_sm, optional message_id.”

• deliver_sm    
– SMSC → ESME    
– “Delivering a mobile-originated SMS or a delivery receipt.”    
– service_type, source_addr (mobile), dest_addr (short-code/ESME), esm_class, data_coding, short_message, plus TLVs for receipted_message_id, message_state (for delivery receipts)

• deliver_sm_resp    
– ESME → SMSC    
– “Received that deliver_sm (or error).”    
– command_status, optional message_id

3. Message Management (query/cancel/replace)    
   — — — — — — — — — —

• query_sm

– “What’s the status of message_id = … ?”    
– message_id, source_addr, dest_addr

• query_sm_resp    
– SMSC → ESME    
– “Here’s the message_state (e.g. ENROUTE, DELIVERED, EXPIRED).”    
– message_id, final_date, message_state, error_code

• cancel_sm    
– ESME → SMSC

– SMSC → ESME    
– “Cancel succeeded (or failed).”

• replace_sm    
– ESME → SMSC    
– “Replace content or timing of message_id = … (while
